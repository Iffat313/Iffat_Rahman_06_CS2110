As stated in the **description**, we look at insertion sort, templates, and operator overloading. For context, we are to sort the array of class objects based on a data member from the class. The data member in question is **"likes".** The issue I ran into was excuting the insertion sort algorithim. It's important to remember that the code was a template, meaning it shouldn't be only orientated for an array of a class type but rather all types! In truth, the hard part was telling the algorithim that an element from an array at index i was less than index i-1. However, for the sake of clarity, we should assume it is for an array of class objects. Furthermore, that's when I realized that I can utlize a overloaded operator as my solution. This is because I would be comparing to class objects of the same class.
